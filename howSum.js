/*********************************** howSum *******************************************
 *
 *    - Write a function `howSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an
 *        array of numbers as arguments.
 *
 *    - The function should return an array containing any combinationg of elements that
 *        add up to exactly the targetSum.
 *      - If there are no combinations that add up to targetSum:
 *          - Return null
 *      - If there are multiple combinations possible:
 *          - Return any combination that works
 *
 *    - Note that this is very similar to canSum, except that instead of returning
 *        a boolean we return the pair of numbers in the array that sum to the targetSum
 *
 *    Arguments: targetSum: integer, numbers: array
 *    Returns:   numbers: array... When summed === targetSum
 *    Example 1: howSum(7, [5, 2]) => [5, 2]
 *    Example 2: howSum(7, [4, 2]) => null
